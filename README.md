# Scramble
Firefox scramble plugin

A Firefox plugin for scrambing web pages. All characters on text nodes within the page will be replaced with random data. Numbers or other special characters will not be scrambled.

  - **Scramble**: Selecting Scramble will scramble the all focused tabs for all windows where the plugin is enabled. Scrambled pages will be rescrambed every second to handle dynamically updated content.
  - **Reset**: Selecting Reset will unscramble all scrambled pages and start a 60 second timeout
until the pages will be rescrambed if no mouse movement have been detected since the timer started.

Nice plugin for scrambling dashboards etc where you don't want to accidentally leak customer or other private data.
